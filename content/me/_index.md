Hello, I’m **Hans ter Horst** — a software developer with a background in **Java** and **Angular**, currently expanding my skills into **DevOps** by building my own **Kubernetes HomeLab**.

At the age of 49, I made the decision to switch careers and learn software development — one of the most exciting and rewarding choices of my life. Since then, I’ve built applications, completed the [**TWN DevOps Bootcamp**](https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/devops-bootcamp), and started hands-on projects that combine my passion for coding, problem-solving, and continuous learning.
