Hello, I’m **Hans ter Horst**, a Software Developer with a background in **Java** and **Angular**, currently transitioning into **DevOps** by building my own **Kubernetes HomeLab**.

At 49, I decided to switch careers and learn software development. Since then, I’ve built applications, completed the [**TWN DevOps Bootcamp**](https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/devops-bootcamp), and started hands-on projects that combine my passion for coding, DevOps, and continuous learning.
