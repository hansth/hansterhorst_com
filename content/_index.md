title: Hello

Hello, I’m **Hans ter Horst** — a software developer with a background in **Java** and **Angular**, now diving into **DevOps** through hands-on learning on my own **HomeLab**.

## My Journey

At the age of 49, I decided to switch careers and learn software development — a choice that turned into one of the most exciting journeys of my life. I began with **Java** and **React**, building applications and **developing my skills as a developer**.

Recently, I completed the [**TWN DevOps Bootcamp**](https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/devops-bootcamp), where I gained a solid foundation in **DevOps practices**, **automation**, **CI/CD**, and **cloud technologies**. To put this into practice, I’ve started my own **Kubernetes HomeLab**, where I can experiment with setups, test new tools, and break things to fix them.

## My Goal

I created this website to **document and share my learning journey**. Writing articles helps me reflect on what I’ve learned while, but also give back to the community that has inspired me. If my experiences can help others — whether they’re learning DevOps or switching careers — then it’s all worth it.

## Beyond Tech

When I’m not coding or experimenting with my HomeLab, I enjoy **listening to music** and watching **biography films about musicians**. You’ll also often find me outdoors — exploring trails on my **mountain bike** or heading out on a **bikepacking adventure**. Being in nature helps me recharge and often sparks new ideas.
