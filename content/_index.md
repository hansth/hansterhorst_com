# Hello

Hi, I’m **Hans ter Horst** — a software developer with a background in **Java** and **Angular** and a passion for
technology and continuous learning.

## My Journey

A few years ago, at the age of 49, I made the leap into software development. It was one of the most exciting and
rewarding decisions of my life. I started working with **Java** and **Angular**, building applications and sharpening my
skills as a developer.

Recently, I completed the [**TWN DevOps Bootcamp**](https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/devops-bootcamp), which opened
the door to a whole new world of modern practices and tools. I’m now diving deeper into **DevOps** — exploring
automation, CI/CD, cloud technologies, and everything in between. To put theory into practice, I'm building my own
**Kubernetes HomeLab**, where I can experiment with setups, test new tools, and break things to fix them, as part of my
hands-on learning.

## My Goal

I created this website to document and share my **learning journey**. Writing notes and articles helps me not only
organize what I’ve learned, but also give back to the community that has helped me so much along the way. If my
experiences can help others who are learning or switching careers into tech, then it’s all worth it.

## Beyond Tech

I’ve always been curious about technology and enjoy exploring new ideas and tools. But when I’m not coding,
tinkering with my **HomeLab**, or experimenting with DevOps tools, you’ll likely find me outdoors on my **mountain bike** enjoying the trails or going on **bikepacking** adventures — clearing my head and finding inspiration and ideas in
nature.
