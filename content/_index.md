title: Hello
---

Hello, I’m **Hans ter Horst**, a Software Developer with a background in **Java** and **Angular**, now transitioning into **DevOps** through hands-on learning on my own **HomeLab**.

## My Journey

At 49, I decided to switch careers and learn Software Development. I began with **Java** and **React**, building applications and **developing my skills as a developer**.

Last year, I completed the [**TWN DevOps Bootcamp**](https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/devops-bootcamp) and earned my **AWS Cloud Practitioner certification**. I started my own **Kubernetes HomeLab** to experiment with setups, test new tools, and break things to fix them.

## My Goal

I created this website to **document and share my learning journey**. Writing articles helps me reflect on what I’ve learned and gives back to the community that inspires me. If my experiences can help others, whether they’re learning DevOps or switching careers, then it’s all worth it!

## Outside the Terminal

When I’m not coding or tinkering with my HomeLab, I enjoy **listening to music** and watching **music movies about musicians**. You’ll also often find me outdoors exploring trails on my **mountain bike** or planning my next **bikepacking adventure**. Being in nature helps me recharge and get inspiration for new ideas.
