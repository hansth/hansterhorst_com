Hi, I’m **Hans ter Horst** — a software developer with a background in **Java** and **Angular**, and a passion for
technology and continuous learning. At the age of 49, I took a leap into software development, and it has been one of
the most exciting and rewarding journeys of my life.

I enjoy building, experimenting, and learning — both through professional projects and personal explorations in my **Kubernetes HomeLab**.
