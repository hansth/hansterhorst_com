Welcome to my **DevOps Learning Journey**, a series of hands-on projects inspired by the [**TWN DevOps Bootcamp**](https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/devops-bootcamp).

After completing the **TWN DevOps Bootcamp**, I wanted to recap my learning by creating a series of **portfolio projects** that combine new DevOps skills with my professional experience in software development.

Here’s the technology stack I’ve been working with:

- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, PostgreSQL, OpenAPI, Liquibase
- **Frontend:** Angular, React
- **CI/CD & Tools:** Jenkins, Docker, Git
- **HomeLab:** Kubernetes

## What This Series Covers

This series documents my step-by-step journey in building a DevOps environment, from infrastructure setup to automation, CI/CD pipelines, and container orchestration.

Each article highlights real, hands-on implementation, showing how I built a secure, modular, and production-ready DevOps setup using modern tools and best practices.
