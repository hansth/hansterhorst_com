Welcome to my **DevOps Learning Journey**, a collection of hands-on projects inspired by the [**TWN DevOps Bootcamp**](https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/devops-bootcamp).

After completing the bootcamp, I created a series of **portfolio projects** that combine my new DevOps skills with my software development background. Each project represents a practical step toward building a complete DevOps environment.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, PostgreSQL, OpenAPI, Liquibase
- **Frontend**: Angular, React
- **CI/CD & Tools**: Jenkins, Docker, Git
- **HomeLab**: Kubernetes

## What This Series Covers

This series documents my step-by-step journey in building a DevOps environment, from infrastructure setup to automation, CI/CD pipelines, and container orchestration.

Each article highlights real, hands-on implementation, showing how I built a secure, modular, and production-ready DevOps setup using modern tools and best practices.
